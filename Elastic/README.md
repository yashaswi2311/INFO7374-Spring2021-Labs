## Elastic Search

Elasticsearch is an open source search engine highly scalable. It allows you to keep and analyse a great volume of information practically in real time. Elasticsearch works with JSON documents files. Using an internal structure, it can parse your data in almost real time to search for the information you need.

It is very useful when working with big data.

Some technical (but useful) information to know about Elasticsearch are:

- It is a real time distributed and analytics engine.
- It is open source, developed in Java.
- It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schema.
- Besides speed and scalability, it has high resiliency relating to failures, and it's really flexible relating to data type.
