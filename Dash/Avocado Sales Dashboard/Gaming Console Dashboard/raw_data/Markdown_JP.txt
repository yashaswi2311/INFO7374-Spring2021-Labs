Microsoft had a different time to promote their Xbox to the Japan gaming market due to their relationship with the game publishers. Due to Microsoft's unwelcomed relationship with game publishers resulted a lack of Japenese gamers' preferred games available in Japan, such as JRPG games. Most of the games Japanese gamers like were available in PlayStation and Nintendo platforms. As there are more PlayStation exclusive games available on the Xbox platform, we may see an mild increase in market share in Xbox.
